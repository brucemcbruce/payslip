## Payslip application

### Dependencies

This application is built on Java 1.8 and Gradle.

Other dependencies (e.g. spring-boot) are managed by Gradle - as long as you build the application using a relatively recent version, these will be automatically downloaded.

### Running the application

The application can be built using Gradle as the build and dependency management tool.
Run "./gradlew clean build" from the application root directory to build a self-executable jar. The can be run using "java -jar ./build/libs/payslip.jar"
